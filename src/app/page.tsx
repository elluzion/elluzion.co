          like working on the web, using frameworks like next.js (which this

        <h4>what else?</h4>
        <p>
          uh, i love cars and tech. driving a '99 mazda mx-5 (miata), i have a
          special interest in both old and new JDM cars, and believe that fun
          and emotion should always play a role in the future of cars, also the
          EVs. nevertheless, i am always looking forward to the future and new
          exciting technologies and opportunities!
